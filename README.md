# hello-world
Learning how github works and such. People involved in our proeject will want to learn how git works so they can contribute if need be to projects Rita is managing.
Start with the https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ guide and tutorial and when done, send an email to ritaturk@gmail.com letting her know you got thru the tutorial.
This file documents the learning experience. This is my first branch, and first changes to our first branch. Commit comes next.
